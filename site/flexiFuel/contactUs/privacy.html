                    You don not want to worry about the whereabouts of your private information when you are searching for travel inspiration or planning your next adventure. That is why we are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us  and why we have created this notice. It tells you who we are, the ways we collect your information, what we do with it, and who we share it with.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li><h1>Your information how we collect it, what we collect, and why:
                          </h1></li>
                    <p>  
                        We collect information about you when:
                        <ul>
                           <li> you give it to us or one of the companies in our group (for example, when you sign up to receive our emails or create a profile on our website or mobile apps),</li>
                           <li> you post content in our products and services (for example, posts you might make to Thorn Tree or within our mobile application Trips by Local Yatri) or via our social media accounts, and</li>
                        sometimes automatically (for example, technical information that transfers when you view our sites or applications on your phone or computer).</ul>
                         We explain each of these in more detail below, but to be clear, Lonely Planet does not, and will not, sell information about you to anyone. We only use your information as set out in this notice and we will only share your information with third parties for commercial purposes such as marketing or promotions if we have your consent to do so; or where we’ve engaged a company outside Lonely Planet to provide a service for us (which might involve them handling your information, but this is only when we have proper safeguards in place); or where we’re obliged by law to share information with authorities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li><h1> When you post content: </h1></li>
                    <p> 
                        We also collect and use personal information contained in photographs and stories that we publish (like faces and other information about people contained in a video or photo, or a story) and that you post to our apps, social media sites, and online forums (like Thorn Tree or Trips by Lonely Planet) or send directly to us. This is so we can:
                        
                        allow you to share your experiences with fellow travelers on our web forums, mobile applications, and social media sites
                        allow us to manage communications among our community and make sure that posts and messages comply with our community guidelines, plus any terms posted on our websites and mobile applications, or on other sites that we use to interact with you like Facebook or Instagram. </p> <a href="#">Back to top</a>

                    <li><h1> When we receive your information automatically: </h1></li>
                    <p>  
                        When you view our sites and applications on your devices, we collect technical information like: the type of device you are using (e.g. phone, computer, other); the version of the operating system running on the device; the version and build of the application being used; anonymous usage statistics and crash reporting data; and unique identifier details for your device such as the IP address (a unique number that identifies your computer whilst accessing the internet), IMEI number (a unique number that identifies your mobile phone), or advertising identifier (unique ID that enables us to show you ads that are targeted to you). However, unique identifiers are anonymized and we do not use this information to identify you as an individual.
                        
                        We consider this necessary either to process and administer your contractual use of our sites and applications, or for our legitimate interests in operating and improving them (including personalizing your user experience).</p>

                    <p>  
                        You have rights in relation to our use of your personal information. We have set out the rights available to people within the European Economic Area below. If you want to contact us about any of your rights, please be specific in your request and send it by email to privacy@local Yatri.com or by post to LP Privacy, Lonely Planet Global, Ltd. Digital Depot, The Digital Hub, Roe Lane, Off Thomas Street, Dublin, D08 TCV4, IRELAND. We will do our best to respond to any request within one month of receiving it, but if your request is complex it may take longer. We aren’t always obliged to say yes to every request: if our answer to your request is no, we’ll explain to you why that is. If you don’t like our answer, you can get in touch with your local supervisory authority</p>
